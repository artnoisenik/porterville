Porterville, Indiana was a small place where many people knew each other and rarely anything exciting happened. Farm land took up much of the space with a few factories and a main street of local entrepreneurs fighting to stay in business. Outside of the county, few people knew of its existence.

In the summer of 2008, the world became very familiar with Porterville when a bloody killing spree rocked the small town. It’s easy to look back on it now as a blip compared to the recession that took hold of the nation, but for those of us that were alive then, it could hardly be forgotten.

What started as a couple teenage crushes quickly escalated into some of the worst Murders the United States had seen. Leaving fourteen people dead and a town torn apart. 

At the time, the media took special interest in the murders they were particularly brutal in their execution. While the United States was just getting comfortable with a culture of mass shootings, the Porterville Murders took place over several weeks with guns playing a small role in the victims’ deaths.

To try to understand the Porterville Murders, I think we need to look at the history of Porterville, Indiana.

Porterville was what you would call an idyllic town. Small, yet industrious, a hub for transportation between neighboring cities, counties, and states. A place where families could raise children among a friendly community. But this was all surface level. If you dug a little deeper, you’d find a past mired in blood, murder, hatred, and fear.
