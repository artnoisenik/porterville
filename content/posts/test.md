### Important People, Places, and Things

**Porterville, Indiana**

The town was named after Capt. David Porter. Early records indicate that the town was called Portersville with an “s”, but at some point in its history the “s” was dropped. The reason for this change and exactly when it happened has been lost to history. While the town may seem an idyllic, Midwestern town, there’s a dark history that runs through it. 

Racism, violence, and death have been a part of the town since the beginning. 

**Barbary County**

Named after the Barbary Wars in which Capt. David Porter, naval officer during the Barbary Wars and the War of 1812. Barbary County became a trading post for the French then English colonizers. The native people were removed from the land during the early to mid 1800s. Porterville (originally Portersville) is the seat of the county, named after Capt. David Porter. 

**Clarence Olsen Redenbacher**

An agricultural agent for the Huber County Farm Bureau that traveled to educate farmers on recent studies, science, and farming practices. He used these travels to capture and torture young men before strangling them with a cord of rope. The burns often looked like kernels of corn. He was known as the Huber County Monster.

Bespectacled and unassuming, Redenbacher was able to befriend his victims. He offered them candy and popcorn before abducting them. Most active during the 1930s and early 1940s, the murders declined by the 1950s due to Clarence settling into new roles as a husband and father, police believe. However, killings started again in the late 1960s. Radenbacher was arrested in 1971 when a shoe of one of his victims, a local boy, was found near his car.

**Bruce Garland Rose House**

Constructed in 1860, this Gothic Revival house is unusual in that it is eight-sided, an octagon. Each of the eight gables include decorated wood panels. The octagon house rose to popularity with the publication in 1849 of Orson Squire Fowler's book A Home For All. Despite Fowler's assertion that the shape was more spacious and cost effective, the awkwardness of the floorplan discouraged many builders. Today, fewer than 120 octagon houses survive nationwide.

Since its construction, the house has been rumored to be the center of dark activity. A meeting house for the Klu Klux Klan until the passing of the original owner Bruce Rose’s daughter, Edith Rose in 1948. Since then the house has passed through a few hands as rumors about it’s purpose persist. 

**Edith Rose** 

Born to Bruce and Esther Rose in 1865, Edith would become known as the grandmother of the KKK as an active member of the Ladies of the Invisible Empire. She used her inheritance to support the systemic deaths of black men and women across the county of Barbary and the state of Indiana. 

A lifelong resident of Porterville, Indiana, Edith inherited her father’s octagonal house and turned it into a meeting place of hatred and bigotry. Since that time, rumors have circulated that the house was used for more than meetings and ritualistic torture and dismemberment took place within the walls of the house. After Edith’s passing, ghost sightings of figures in the yard have been consistently reported among locals.
